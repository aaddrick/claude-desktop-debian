# Claude Desktop for Linux

This project provides build scripts to run Claude Desktop natively on Linux systems. It repackages the official Windows application for Linux distributions, producing `.deb` packages (Debian/Ubuntu), `.rpm` packages (Fedora/RHEL), distribution-agnostic AppImages, and an [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/claude-desktop-appimage) for Arch Linux.

**Note:** This is an unofficial build script. For official support, please visit [Anthropic's website](https://www.anthropic.com). For issues with the build script or Linux implementation, please [open an issue](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues) in this repository.

> **⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL: Cowork Mode Support**
> Cowork mode is **enabled by default** in this build. It uses the same TypeScript VM client as Windows, communicating over a Unix domain socket to a local service daemon. To use it, start a Cowork session from the Claude Desktop UI.
> **Important:** Cowork mode on Linux currently runs Claude Code **directly on the host** with no VM isolation. Unlike macOS/Windows, there is no sandbox—Claude has access to your entire home directory. VM-based isolation (QEMU/KVM) is actively being developed. Use Cowork mode only if you understand the security implications.

## Features

- **Native Linux Support**: Run Claude Desktop without virtualization or Wine
- **MCP Support**: Full Model Context Protocol integration
  Configuration file location: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **System Integration**:
  - Global hotkey support (Ctrl+Alt+Space) - works on X11 and Wayland (via XWayland)
  - System tray integration
  - Desktop environment integration

## Installation

### Using APT Repository (Debian/Ubuntu - Recommended)

Add the repository for automatic updates via `apt`:

```bash
# Add the GPG key
curl -fsSL https://aaddrick.github.io/claude-desktop-debian/KEY.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/claude-desktop.gpg

# Add the repository
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/claude-desktop.gpg arch=amd64,arm64] https://aaddrick.github.io/claude-desktop-debian stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/claude-desktop.list

# Update and install
sudo apt update
sudo apt install claude-desktop
```

Future updates will be installed automatically with your regular system updates (`sudo apt upgrade`).

### Using DNF Repository (Fedora/RHEL - Recommended)

Add the repository for automatic updates via `dnf`:

```bash
# Add the repository
sudo curl -fsSL https://aaddrick.github.io/claude-desktop-debian/rpm/claude-desktop.repo -o /etc/yum.repos.d/claude-desktop.repo

# Install
sudo dnf install claude-desktop
```

Future updates will be installed automatically with your regular system updates (`sudo dnf upgrade`).

### Using AUR (Arch Linux)

The [`claude-desktop-appimage`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/claude-desktop-appimage) package is available on the AUR and is automatically updated with each release.

```bash
# Using yay
yay -S claude-desktop-appimage

# Or using paru
paru -S claude-desktop-appimage
```

The AUR package installs the AppImage build of Claude Desktop.

### Using Pre-built Releases

Download the latest `.deb`, `.rpm`, or `.AppImage` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/releases).

### Building from Source

See [docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md) for detailed build instructions.

## Configuration

Model Context Protocol settings are stored in:
```
~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

For additional configuration options including environment variables and Wayland support, see [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

## Troubleshooting

For troubleshooting common issues, uninstallation instructions, and log locations, see [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
