# Linux Compatibility Test Harness

In-VM (or on-host) Playwright + DBus runner for the test cases under
[`docs/testing/cases/`](../../docs/testing/cases/). See
[`docs/testing/automation.md`](../../docs/testing/automation.md) for the
architecture, decisions, and rationale.

## Status

First vertical slice — covers four tests on KDE-W:

| Test | What it checks | Layer |
|------|----------------|-------|
| [T01](../../docs/testing/cases/launch.md#t01--app-launch) | Main window opens within 10s; launcher log mentions X11/XWayland on Wayland sessions | L1 + L2 |
| [T03](../../docs/testing/cases/tray-and-window-chrome.md#t03--tray-icon-present) | A `StatusNotifierItem` is registered by the claude-desktop pid | L2 (DBus) |
| [T04](../../docs/testing/cases/tray-and-window-chrome.md#t04--window-decorations-draw) | Window has `_NET_FRAME_EXTENTS` (sum > 0) and a "Claude" title | L2 (xprop) |
| [T17](../../docs/testing/cases/code-tab-foundations.md#t17--folder-picker-opens) | Renderer triggers `dialog.showOpenDialog` (shallow v1; portal mock is v2) | L1 (Electron-level intercept) |

These four exercise every distinct shape of TS code in the harness:
`playwright-electron`, `dbus-next`, shell-out helpers (`xprop`, `xdotool`),
and Electron-main-process intercepts. Everything beyond them should be
recombination.

## Prerequisites

On the host or VM running the sweep:

- Node.js ≥ 20
- `claude-desktop` installed (deb / rpm / AppImage), reachable via `claude-desktop` on `PATH` or `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_LAUNCHER` env var
- `xprop`, `xdotool` (for L2 window queries — `dnf install xorg-x11-utils xdotool` on Fedora; `apt install x11-utils xdotool` on Debian/Ubuntu)
- `zstd` (optional — used to bundle results)

## Install

```sh
cd tools/test-harness
npm install
```

`package-lock.json` is gitignored for now; commit it once the dep set is settled.

## Run

```sh
# All four tests against the locally installed claude-desktop
ROW=KDE-W ./orchestrator/sweep.sh

# Single test
npx playwright test src/runners/T01_app_launch.spec.ts

# Headed (watch the app launch in front of you)
npx playwright test --headed
```

Results land at `results/results-${ROW}-${DATE}/`:

```
results/results-KDE-W-20260430T143000Z/
├── junit.xml             # JUnit summary (matrix-regen input)
├── html/                 # Playwright HTML report
└── test-output/          # Per-test attachments (screenshots, logs, etc.)
```

A bundled `results-${ROW}-${DATE}.tar.zst` sits next to the dir if `zstd`
is installed.

## Environment variables

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `ROW` | `KDE-W` | Matrix row label, propagated into the bundle name and per-test annotations |
| `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_LAUNCHER` | `claude-desktop` (PATH lookup) | Path to the launcher / Electron binary Playwright spawns |
| `OUTPUT_DIR` | `./results` | Where bundles land |
| `RESULTS_DIR` | per-run derived | Single-run output dir (set by `sweep.sh`; usually you don't set this manually) |

## Known limitations (v1)

- **T04** uses `xprop` + `xdotool`, which work on X11 native and on KDE Wayland (XWayland), but **not** on native-Wayland sessions where the app is running through Ozone-Wayland directly. Per Decision 6, project default is X11; native-Wayland window-state queries are deferred until those tests get added.
- **T17** is shallow — it intercepts `dialog.showOpenDialog` at the Electron main process level. The integration question "does Claude make the right *portal* call?" is a v2 concern; portal-level mocking via `dbus-next` is sketched in [`docs/testing/automation.md`](../../docs/testing/automation.md) but requires displacing the running portal service or running under `dbus-run-session`.
- **`render-matrix.sh`** isn't here yet. `sweep.sh` prints a summary; the `matrix.md` regen step from JUnit is the next addition.
- **No CI wrapper.** Decision 4: the harness is invokable from CI but sweeps run from the dev box for the first ~20 tests.

## Adding a test

1. Pick the `T##` / `S##` from [`docs/testing/cases/`](../../docs/testing/cases/).
2. Drop `src/runners/T##_short_name.spec.ts`. Use the existing four as templates.
3. Tag the test with `severity` and `surface` annotations so the JUnit output carries them.
4. Capture diagnostics via `testInfo.attach()` — these become Decision 7 "always-on" captures regardless of pass/fail.
5. No fixed `sleep`s. Use `retryUntil` or Playwright's auto-wait.
